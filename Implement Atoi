Your task  is to implement the function atoi. The function takes a string(str) as argument and converts it to an integer and returns it.

Note: You are not allowed to use inbuilt function.

Example 1:

Input:
str = 123
Output: 123
Example 2:

Input:
str = 21a
Output: -1
Explanation: Output is -1 as all
characters are not digit only.
Your Task:
Complete the function atoi() which takes a string as input parameter and returns integer value of it. if the input string is not a numerical string then returns -1.
Note: Numerical strings are the string where either every character is in between 0-9 or where the first character is '-' and the rest all characters are in between 0-9.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|), |S| = length of string str.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of S ≤ 10

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.


PROGRAM:
C++

SOLUTION:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
class Solution{
  public:
    /*You are required to complete this method */
    int atoi(string str) {
        //Your code here
        int res= 0;
        int i=0;
        int flag= 1;
        if(str[0]=='-') {
            flag=-1;
            i++;
        }
        for(i; i<str.length(); i++) {
            if((str[i]-'0')>=0 && (str[i]-'0')<=9) {
                res= res*10+ (str[i]-'0');
            } else {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        
        return res*flag;
    
    }
};
int main() {
    string s;
    cin>>s;
    Solution s1;
    cout<<s1.atoi(s);
  return 0;  
}
